Fonts:
•	You should use any of these three fonts which are "Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif".

Lists:
•	Make sure the spacing of your lists and list items works well with the styling of the overall page. 
Each list item should  have the same line-height as a paragraph line, and each list should have the 
same spacing at its top and bottom as you have between paragraphs.
•	Give your list items a nice bullet, appropriate for the design of the page. 
It is up to you whether you choose a custom bullet image or something else.
